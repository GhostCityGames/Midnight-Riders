<h2>PRELUDE</h2>
<p>Under the white light of the full moon, two motorcycles race down a long stretch of desert road. The trailing biker builds speed and draws a sawed-off shotgun from her saddle bag. She fires at the leading biker, sending him flying into the sand. She slides to a stop and hops off her bike to finish the job. She steadies her aim at the man who is now collapsed on all fours in a massive cloud of dust. Strangely, his silhouette now seems bigger. The dust settles and the man looks out with glowing eyes. He howls wildly at the moon and lunges for the kill…</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In Midnight Riders, everyone role-plays her own Player Character (PC) who is a member of a rival biker gang and undergoing monstrous transformations. Ghosts, vampires, psychics, werewolves, and aliens are not unheard of in this game’s world. Think Sons of Anarchy meets Monster Mash as a point of reference for the game’s tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objective">
<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>Midnight Riders is a competitive role-playing game (RPG). You will aim to climb the ranks of your own gang and eliminate all rival threats from the other PCs. Your street smarts and your paranormal abilities will help you on your way to the top. Over the course of six Events, you will track your PC’s changing social standing, referred to as Reputation, and her evolving beastly powers, referred to as Madness. If a single player has both the highest Reputation and Madness scores at the end of the game, that player automatically wins. Otherwise, a final round, Hell to Pay, will take place after the sixth Event to determine the story’s conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup">
<h2>SETUP</h2>
<p>To play, you will need D4, D6, D8, D10, and D12 dice and a way to record your character’s stats, such as pen and paper. Start your PC at 0 Reputation and 0 Madness. Begin the game by describing your PC’s history, personality, gang life, and the world in which your Events will take place. Next, create a backstory that explains how your character possesses some supernatural traits. Once everyone has agreed upon the setting and cast of characters, players perform the first d12 roll-off to determine turn order. The determined first player rolls a d4 and d12 against the Happenings table (pg 14) INSERTlink for the first time and the game begins with the first player’s Scene in the first Event.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turn-order">
<h2>TURN ORDER</h2>
<p>At the beginning of each Event, all players roll a d12. Turn order follows highest roll descending to lowest roll. The player with the highest roll is labeled the first player for that Event. The first player is responsible for rolling against the Happenings table (pg 14) INSERTlink for that Event and then establishing the first Scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scoring">
<h2>SCORING</h2>
<p>You will aim to gain points whenever your PC is involved in a Scene, either in Scenes you describe starring your PC or in Scenes other players describe that involve your PC. The number of points you stand to win is determined by the type of opponent you battle and your own Madness or Reputation score: the higher your score, the higher the die you will roll to reflect your growing powers. Conversely, the lower your score, the lower the die you will roll in Scenes. See Table 1 on opposite page.</p>
<p>There are two types of opponents: PCs or NPCs (Non-Player Characters). PCs are other players’ rival gang members battling for highest Madness and Reputation. NPCs are other characters temporarily played by a player in a Scene and are assigned a die depending on their difficulty. Teens, petty thieves, and bystanders are examples of d4 NPCs. Gang members and police are examples of d6 NPCs. Supernatural creatures and slayers are examples of the highest NPC die, D8. You score points at the climax of a Scene’s conflict when PCs roll their respective dice to determine a winner. If a PC loses a roll against an NPC, stay at the same score. If a PC loses a roll against a PC, the loser stays at the same score and the winner gains points indicated by Table 2 below. It is impossible to lose points unless a Happening explicitly states otherwise. A player can never drop below a score of 0 Reputation or 0 Madness. Ties and tiebreakers are addressed in the Scenes section (pg 4). INSERTlink</p>

<h2>REPUTATION &amp; MADNESS</h2>
<p>As PCs navigate gang politics and grow into their wicked powers, you must track their progress. Reputation represents a PC’s influence and sway in the gang world. Madness represents the strength of a PC’s supernatural abilities. These scores will change over the course of the game as a result of Scenes in which your PC participates. A player can never drop below a score of 0 Reputation or 0 Madness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="events">
<h2>EVENTS</h2>
<p>Gameplay occurs across six themed rounds, referred to as Events, in which each player will take a turn to establish a Scene. You may interpret these themes how you see fit. Turn order is determined by a d12 roll-off before the first Scene of each Event. The determined first player for the Event rolls a d4 and d12 against the Happenings table (pg 14) INSERTlink before she establishes her Scene to determine any special circumstances that might take place in the story. Each player will describe a Scene during this Event, influenced appropriately by the selected Happening.</p>
<p>The Events will unfold as follows:
1. A Club Celebration
2. A Big Delivery of Goods
3. Money Changing Hands
4. Desperate Measures
5. The King is Dead
6. Anarchy
Conclusion: Hell to Pay</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scenes">
<h2>SCENES</h2>
<p>Each player will have a turn to describe a Scene starring her PC during every Event. When it is your turn to describe a Scene, describe the location of the scene and any characters you’d like to be present.</p>
<p>You may describe a Scene with NPCs and other players will volunteer to role-play these characters for the duration of the Scene. You may also describe a Scene with a rival PC that your fellow player must role-play. Your scene will ultimately involve a conflict that you will try to win in order to gain points to either your Reputation or Madness score. Decide at the beginning of your Scene if you aim to gain Reputation or Madness.</p>
<p>A Scene centered around gaining Reputation will likely involve role-playing criminal activities, but there’s no reason your supernatural powers must be entirely left out of the story! A Scene centered around gaining Madness will likely involve role-playing paranormal occurrences.</p>
<p>When a conflict arises, opponents roll off and potentially gain points according to the Scoring section (pg 2). INSERTlink Your conflict roll must always involve only one opponent, whether that is an NPC or a PC. In the Happenings that state otherwise, the highest roller of all characters involved in the conflict wins and follows standard scoring rules. PCs may only act as allies in a Scene when a Happening states such or during the final round, Hell to Pay. For these PC alliances, use the highest die roll from all players cooperating on that side during the conflict. In the event of a tie, each side rolls a d12 and the highest roll wins.</p>
<p>It is not possible to kill a PC and end a fellow player’s game. You can certainly attempt to kill a PC, and perhaps role-play the belief that a PC has been killed, but a PC will always narrowly survive. See Appendix 1 (pg 9) INSERTlink for an example playing a Scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="happenings">
<h2>HAPPENINGS</h2>
<p>Happenings provide context, direction, and consequences for the Scenes in each Event of the game. At the beginning of each Event, the designated first player rolls a d4 to determine the category (Family, Market, Gang, Cops), and then rolls a d12 to randomly determine the Happening within that category.</p>
<p>Some results describe Happenings that affect all players; other results describe risky but rewarding scenarios that players may elect to engage in; other results affect a player randomly selected by rolling a die. The Happenings table is located in Appendix 2 (pg 14). INSERTlink</p>

<div class="section" id="hell-to-pay">
<h2>HELL TO PAY</h2>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>After all players have described their Scenes in the sixth Event, a winner is determined in the conclusion, Hell to Pay. The conditions of the game’s end are described as follows:</dt>
<dd><p>Condition 1</p>
</dd>
<dt>If a player possesses both the highest Madness and highest Reputation scores, she automatically wins the game. Describe how your bold and beastly PC has gone berserk and ascended the ranks to rule the streets. All other players may describe their PCs’ doomed fates.</dt>
<dd><p>Condition 2</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If a player possesses the highest Madness but not the highest Reputation, then prepare for a bloody battle for top position. The player with the highest Madness must describe her PC’s diabolical scheme to rule the streets with supernatural powers. All other PCs must fight one another’s rival gangs in a last attempt to take down this beastly rival threat. In the event of a tie between two players with the highest Madness, each PC rolls a d12 and the highest roll wins. The loser must compete with other PCs in the bracket system described below. During all conflicts in Hell to Pay, PCs roll their dice as dictated in the Scoring section (pg 2) INSERTlink but also add their PCs’ Reputation scores to their rolls when determining a winner.</p>
<p>PCs who do not have the highest Madness roll off in a bracket system. The two players with the lowest Reputation scores battle one another first. Determine winners and losers until only one PC remains to battle the player with the highest Madness. This triumphant player has two choices: she may either battle the PC with the highest Madness alone or she may recruit her final defeated opponent to battle the beast together. As an alternative to the final roll off in the bracket system, the two last PCs standing can call a truce rather than roll off against each other and choose to team up against the player with the highest Madness.</p>
<p>The final battle involves a best 3 out of 5 roll off. If only two players are in contention, roll dice as dictated in the Scoring section (pg 2) INSERTlink with one addition: the PC with the highest Madness adds her Madness score to her roll and the opponent PC adds her Reputation score to her roll. If two players take on the PC with the highest Madness together, dice rules vary. Roll the highest die associated with either PC’s Reputation scores to represent both PCs, then add both PCs’ Reputation scores to the roll. For example, if the two PCs have Reputation scores of 5 and 8, they would roll 1d8+5+8 to represent them both.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome of this battle, describe the consequences in your story. Consider how the winner of the game seizes power, what it means if rivals collaborated, what happens to the gangs and characters of your world, and any other details that help shape an exciting conclusion.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX 1 - SCENE PLAY EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Abbie: Okay, my character really needs to step up her game. I was thinking of going for Madness, but the Happening mentioned that I’d have to roll a lower die. Probably not a bad idea to get more Reputation anyway. I think I’ll set my Scene by the wharf. I’m going to meet my contact named…Rancid Randy! Hank, will you play Randy?</p>
<p>Hank: Yeah!</p>
<p>Abbie: Okay, I know that Randy is obsessed with these great chili dogs at the pier. I’m going to run into him at the diner while he’s eating. I want to see if I can convince you to make a better deal with my group.</p>
<p>Hank: Dang, you have to catch me while I’m minding my own business!?</p>
<p>Abbie: Yep. See, I figure things could get violent between you and me, so I want to set it somewhere public. Wait, I have an idea! What if we have to kind of speak in code since we’re at the diner. Like, Frankie, do you want to be the waitress behind the counter?</p>
<p>Frankie: Definitely.</p>
<p>Abbie: Okay. So, I walk in and sit down at the empty bar stool next to Rancid Randy.</p>
<p>Frankie: Hey, hun. What’ll you have?</p>
<p>Abbie: Give me two of these fine chili dogs like my friend here. And I punch Randy on the arm.</p>
<p>Hank: Once the waitress is out of the way I lean in. Jesus, I can’t catch a break from you. Why are you here?</p>
<p>Abbie: You know you can’t get rid of me. And don’t forget it. Bottom line is we need some more…</p>
<p>Frankie: And here’s some water, darling.</p>
<p>Abbie: Thanks. I guess the waitress is kind of hovering around filling up drinks and putting together an order. I say quietly, yeah, Randy, we need more…sodas, yeah, sodas, for this weekend’s…barbecue.</p>
<p>Hank: You know…I feel like I really looked over your budget and you can’t afford any more sodas.</p>
<p>Abbie: Maybe, maybe. But looking back at our arrangement, I think you could do better. I think for the same price of that RC Cola you’re bringing around you could really do Coca Cola.</p>
<p>Frankie: What was that? Sorry, we only have Pepsi.</p>
<p>Abbie: Oh, that’s fine. Anyway, Randy, you see where I’m coming from. You haven’t been pulling your weight on this…catering job…for a while now, but things have changed. It’s time to level up here.</p>
<p>Hank: Yeah…I don’t really see that happening. I’ve got some good things going here and I don’t see why I’d let you mess that up for me.</p>
<p>Abbie: Oh, Randy, you know my motto: no excuses! And I stretch my arms up, pretending to yawn, and reveal my gun in its holster. Okay, I’m going to roll to see if I can convince him to get straight with me here. My current Reputation score is 5 so that means I’ll be rolling a d6.</p>
<p>Hank: Right. And since Randy’s a criminal NPC, I roll a d6. So if you beat me, you’ll get 2 points.</p>
<p>Abbie: Let’s roll! Yes! I win. Deal with it, Randy! I’m up 2 points. And now that I’m at 7 I’ll be rolling a d8 for Reputation. I look Randy in the eye and can tell something sinks inside of him. It’s subtle, but as I stare him down, a ghastly green flame is in my eyes. He’ll back down now. I can tell he caves right as the food is ready.</p>
<p>Frankie: All right, two chili dogs for you. Anything else?</p>
<p>Abbie: Thanks! And yeah I think throw a milkshake on there. My friend here’s buying.</p>

<p>Rita: Right, Joe. You and Tim have the lowest Reputation scores. You need to roll off to see which gangs will go for the glory and take down that freak, Steph.</p>

<p>Tim: Yeah, and I have 5 Reputation, so I’ll roll a d6+5. Let’s roll!</p>

<p>Tim: Ha! My samurai zombie crashes into your headquarters and starts slicing off people’s limbs left and right. You’re done for.</p>

<p>Tim: Right, that’s why I’m roping you into it. Plus, working together, we will get to use your d8 since it’s the highest of our dice + my 5 + your 7. It would be our d8+12 against Steph’s d10+12. We’d have a shot!</p>
<p>Rita: Obviously my character isn’t happy, but she’s bound to you showing her mercy. And I’d rather we both win than Steph!</p>
<p>Steph: Oh, hell no! No way.</p>
<p>Rita: It’s happening, Steph. Tim and I ride through the desert all night and we’re on your trail. I see that glowing yellow storm you’re brewing up in the mountains.</p>
<p>Steph: Yep, when I finish casting this spell, I’ll be taking you all out with my noxious psycho-storm.</p>
<p>Tim: Not if we have anything to say about it! I fly up the mountain on my hog and the moonlight shines off the samurai sword strapped to my back.</p>
<p>Rita: And my slime bazooka is set to kill.</p>
<p>Steph: Okay, let’s roll! Your highest die plus your combined Reputation scores. So that’s your d8+12 and my d10+12. Best 3 out of 5.</p>

<td><p>A big meeting is taking place at the cemetery. If you
elect to describe a Scene here, you may roll the die
associated with your highest score, Reputation or
Madness, regardless of which one you seek to improve
in this scene.</p>
<p>A meeting with the supplier is scheduled for the full
moon. If any player gains Madness while describing a
Scene under the moonlight, gain +1 Madness.</p>
<p>The gangs have been lucky enough to get their hands
on a small supply of primo stuff. During the Scene you
describe, you may take these drugs to receive a +1 to
your Madness roll, or you may hold off and sell the
goods to receive a +1 to your Reputation roll.</p>
<p>Randomly select two players. The first player has
planted some poisoned dope in the second player’s
territory. The first PC gains +1 Reputation and the
second PC gains +1 Madness.</p>
<p>Mysterious, humming eggs have found their way into
your latest shipment of goods. If any player wishes to
eat the egg, your PC gains +1 Madness. If you wish to
keep the egg, it will hatch into a baby monster. For
the rest of the game, you can roll a d4 in addition to
your current Madness die and take the highest roll.</p>
<p>The biggest name in the Game (d10) has arrived from
overseas and is looking for partners. Only once during
this Event, a player may initiate this
Reputation-based Scene, but all players may freely
join in. You may try to score big by any means
necessary, so roll your highest die. If you describe
your Scene alone and win the kingpin’s favor, gain +6
Reputation. However, if you wish to call a truce and
other players choose to join in, take the group’s
highest roll and, on a success, each PC gains +4
Reputation.</p>
<p>Randomly select one PC. Your best friend has overdosed
dosed after swearing off the stuff. Your PC is too
distraught to participate in Reputation storylines
during this Event, but they also feel enraged. Add +1
to any Madness rolls during this Event.</p>
<p>You’ve caught word that undercover cops have been
present at major goings on. People are suspicious and
tension is high. If you lose a Reputation roll against
a rival PC, you may automatically gain +1 Madness.</p>
<p>A randomly selected player seems to be followed by
government agents and all her contacts on the street
can sense it. Immediately lose -1 Reputation.</p>
<p>Your enemies have been spreading rumors that you
are some kind of abomination. If you role-play your
monstrous side around rival NPCs to gain Madness,
you gain +1 to your Madness roll. However, if you lose
the roll, then immediately lose -1 Reputation.</p>
<p>Randomly select one player. A recent batch of drugs
sends your PC into a horrific rage. Decide whether
this means your monstrous side is empowered or whether
other PCs cower away in fear. Elect to gain +1 to all
Madness or all Reputation rolls during this Event.</p>
<p>Archaic sigils and graffiti appear near your gang’s
headquarters. Do monster hunters exist? Someone
knows about you, and these markings seem to be
draining your energy. If any PCs attempt to gain
Madness during this Event, then they must roll the
next lowest die.</p>

<dt>d2  The police are starting a special department for</dt>
<dd><p>supernatural investigation. If anyone uses Madness,
the police will be on to you, and you must roll the next
lowest die for this Event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d3  The police are doing drills today, and will assume</dt>
<dd><p>anything you do is part of the tests. Gain +1 on rolls for
either Madness or Reputation if the police are involved
in your Scene.</p>

<dt>d4  Trick or Treat! It’s Halloween and the cops are too</dt>
<dd><p>busy busting teenagers. With the heat off your tails,
PCs add +1 to any Madness rolls during this Event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d5  Is your refrigerator running? The police think all the</dt>
<dd><p>complaints about the supernatural occurrences are
“prank calls.” All PCs may add +2 to Madness rolls
during this Event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d6  The cops are pulling off a sting on all the gangs! Any</dt>
<dd><p>players that roll for Madness will draw more attention
to themselves, and if they fail their roll, must drop their
Reputation to a d4 for the rest of this Event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d7  An informant has infiltrated your gang! Reputation</dt>
<dd><p>rolls for a randomly selected player take a -1 penalty
during this Event.</p>

<dd><p>Think you can steal the goods? If you elect to
describe this risky scene, you must roll off against four
officers. Take the highest of the officers’ 4d6 rolls. If
you succeed, you pull off the heist and gain an addi-
tional +3 Reputation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d9  There’s a new head of the police force in town, and his</dt>
<dd><p>name is Captain Van Hellsting (d10). He came here to
chew bubblegum and slay monsters, and he’s all out of
bubblegum. Any rolls for Madness during this event
will draw him out and you must fight him. Any number
of players can team up against him. Use the highest roll
of all participating PCs. If he is defeated, everyone
included in the fight will share 6 Madness and 6
Reputation however they see fit. If the captain is
defeated, he’s dead, and no other PC’s may fight him in
their scenes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d10 The truth is out there! Randomly select one PC. Special</dt>
<dd><p>FBI Agents are investigating some of the occurrences
surrounding your gang. Any Madness rolls you make
during this Event will tip off the agents and you lose -2
Madness if you fail the roll.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d11 During a police interrogation, a randomly selected</dt>
<dd><p>player can choose to squeal on any number of other
players. If you do, you gain +1 Reputation for each
player you compromise. The impacted players each lose -1
Reputation, but also gain +1 Madness each.</p>

once during this Event, a player may initiate this Scene.
All players may freely join in. If you confess to killing
this person, gain +1 Madness. Any PCs who choose to
fight the suspected killer immediately gain +1 Reputation
in addition to usual scoring rules.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d4  Today is a major holiday and all the gangs will be cele-</dt>
<dd><p>brating. All PCs plan to spend the holiday at home, so
any hostile confrontations with NPCs or PCs must take
place over the phone. If you wish to describe such a
phone conversation, you must be sure to be out of ear-
shot of eavesdropping family members! Anyone who
loses a roll during this Event loses -1 Reputation point
for being overheard.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d5  Randomly select one player. One of your closest allies</dt>
<dd><p>is spreading rumors about you. Decide now, do you
ignore the rumors to receive -1 to all Reputation rolls
but +1 to all Madness rolls during this Event? Or do you
humiliate your friend to receive +1 to all Reputation
rolls but -1 to all Madness rolls during this Event?</p>

<dt>d6  Family motorcycle races can be fun but unforgiving.</dt>

a win, gain +2 additional Reputation, but lose -1
Madness.</p>

<dt>d7  A ghastly purple haze covers the city and visibly brings</dt>
<dd><p>out everyone’s supernatural side. Eyes glow brighter;
tails grow bushier; muscles bulge stronger. All players
must consider whether their PCs’ families have the
same monstrous qualities as the players. If you decide
the entire family is supernatural, describe the family in
a scene to gain +3 to any Madness roll but lose -1 Repu-
tation for putting your family in harm’s way. If you de-
cide only the PC is supernatural, gain +3 to Reputation
rolls as you frighten your enemies and lose -1 Madness
as you try to hide and suppress your beastly features in
front of your family.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d8  It’s the first day back to school. Gang tension is high,</dt>
<dd><p>but everyone will respect this special time for each
other’s children. Players cannot describe any violent
Scenes during daylight hours throughout this Event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d9  Randomly select one player. A fellow gang member is</dt>
<dd><p>hit by a drive-by. Decide now whether your gang would
pursue the shooter immediately or plan revenge. If
you would pursue, you boost morale, but the gang feels
weaker: add +1 to all Reputation rolls, but subtract
-1 to all Madness rolls during this Event. If you seek
revenge, you lower morale, but your vicious plans fire
everyone up: subtract -1 to all Reputation rolls but add
+1 to all Madness rolls during this Event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>d10 Randomly select one player. You are tasked with look-</dt>
<dd><p>ing after a fellow gang member’s young, bumbling sib-

gain +1 Reputation, but lose -1 Madness after scoring as
normal. If you want to abandon the kid, lose -1 Reputa-
tion, but gain +1 Madness after scoring as normal.</p>

Event.</p>

decision tears you up.</p>
