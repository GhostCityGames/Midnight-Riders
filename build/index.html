<h2>PRELUDE</h2>
<p>Under the white light of the full moon, two motorcycles race down a long stretch of desert road. The trailing biker builds speed and draws a sawed-off shotgun from her saddle bag. She fires at the leading biker, sending him flying into the sand. She slides to a stop and hops off her bike to finish the job. She steadies her aim at the man who is now collapsed on all fours in a massive cloud of dust. Strangely, his silhouette now seems bigger. The dust settles and the man looks out with glowing eyes. He howls wildly at the moon and lunges for the kill...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In Midnight Riders, everyone role-plays her own Player Character (PC) who is a member of a rival biker gang and undergoing monstrous transformations. Ghosts, vampires, psychics, werewolves, and aliens are not unheard of in this game’s world. Think Sons of Anarchy meets Monster Mash as a point of reference for the game’s tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objective">
<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>Midnight Riders is a competitive role-playing game (RPG). You will aim to climb the ranks of your own gang and eliminate all rival threats from the other PCs. Your street smarts and your paranormal abilities will help you on your way to the top. Over the course of six Events, you will track your PC’s changing social standing, referred to as Reputation, and her evolving beastly powers, referred to as Madness. If a single player has both the highest Reputation and Madness scores at the end of the game, that player automatically wins. Otherwise, a final round, Hell to Pay, will take place after the sixth Event to determine the story’s conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup">
<h2>SETUP</h2>
<p>To play, you will need D4, D6, D8, D10, and D12 dice and a way to record your character’s stats, such as pen and paper. Start your PC at 0 Reputation and 0 Madness. Begin the game by describing your PC’s history, personality, gang life, and the world in which your Events will take place. Next, create a backstory that explains how your character possesses some supernatural traits. Once everyone has agreed upon the setting and cast of characters, players perform the first d12 roll-off to determine turn order. The determined first player rolls a d4 and d12 against the Happenings table (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg14">pg14</a>) for the first time and the game begins with the first player’s Scene in the first Event.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turn-order">
<h2>TURN ORDER</h2>
<p>At the beginning of each Event, all players roll a d12. Turn order follows highest roll descending to lowest roll. The player with the highest roll is labeled the first player for that Event. The first player is responsible for rolling against the Happenings table (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg14">pg14</a>) for that Event and then establishing the first Scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scoring">
<span id="pg2"></span><h2>SCORING</h2>
<p>You will aim to gain points whenever your PC is involved in a Scene, either in Scenes you describe starring your PC or in Scenes other players describe that involve your PC. The number of points you stand to win is determined by the type of opponent you battle and your own Madness or Reputation score: the higher your score, the higher the die you will roll to reflect your growing powers. Conversely, the lower your score, the lower the die you will roll in Scenes. See Table 1 on opposite page.</p>
<p>There are two types of opponents: PCs or NPCs (Non-Player Characters). PCs are other players’ rival gang members battling for highest Madness and Reputation. NPCs are other characters temporarily played by a player in a Scene and are assigned a die depending on their difficulty. Teens, petty thieves, and bystanders are examples of d4 NPCs. Gang members and police are examples of d6 NPCs. Supernatural creatures and slayers are examples of the highest NPC die, D8. You score points at the climax of a Scene’s conflict when PCs roll their respective dice to determine a winner. If a PC loses a roll against an NPC, stay at the same score. If a PC loses a roll against a PC, the loser stays at the same score and the winner gains points indicated by Table 2 below. It is impossible to lose points unless a Happening explicitly states otherwise. A player can never drop below a score of 0 Reputation or 0 Madness. Ties and tiebreakers are addressed in the Scenes section (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg4">pg4</a>).</p>

<div class="section" id="reputation-madness">
<h2>REPUTATION &amp; MADNESS</h2>
<p>As PCs navigate gang politics and grow into their wicked powers, you must track their progress. Reputation represents a PC’s influence and sway in the gang world. Madness represents the strength of a PC’s supernatural abilities. These scores will change over the course of the game as a result of Scenes in which your PC participates. A player can never drop below a score of 0 Reputation or 0 Madness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="events">
<h2>EVENTS</h2>
<p>Gameplay occurs across six themed rounds, referred to as Events, in which each player will take a turn to establish a Scene. You may interpret these themes how you see fit. Turn order is determined by a d12 roll-off before the first Scene of each Event. The determined first player for the Event rolls a d4 and d12 against the Happenings table (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg14">pg14</a>) before she establishes her Scene to determine any special circumstances that might take place in the story. Each player will describe a Scene during this Event, influenced appropriately by the selected Happening.</p>
<p>The Events will unfold as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A Club Celebration</li>
<li>A Big Delivery of Goods</li>
<li>Money Changing Hands</li>
<li>Desperate Measures</li>
<li>The King is Dead</li>
<li>Anarchy</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: Hell to Pay</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scenes">
<span id="pg4"></span><h2>SCENES</h2>
<p>Each player will have a turn to describe a Scene starring her PC during every Event. When it is your turn to describe a Scene, describe the location of the scene and any characters you’d like to be present.</p>
<p>You may describe a Scene with NPCs and other players will volunteer to role-play these characters for the duration of the Scene. You may also describe a Scene with a rival PC that your fellow player must role-play. Your scene will ultimately involve a conflict that you will try to win in order to gain points to either your Reputation or Madness score. Decide at the beginning of your Scene if you aim to gain Reputation or Madness.</p>
<p>A Scene centered around gaining Reputation will likely involve role-playing criminal activities, but there’s no reason your supernatural powers must be entirely left out of the story! A Scene centered around gaining Madness will likely involve role-playing paranormal occurrences.</p>
<p>When a conflict arises, opponents roll off and potentially gain points according to the Scoring section (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg2">pg2</a>). Your conflict roll must always involve only one opponent, whether that is an NPC or a PC. In the Happenings that state otherwise, the highest roller of all characters involved in the conflict wins and follows standard scoring rules. PCs may only act as allies in a Scene when a Happening states such or during the final round, Hell to Pay. For these PC alliances, use the highest die roll from all players cooperating on that side during the conflict. In the event of a tie, each side rolls a d12 and the highest roll wins.</p>
<p>It is not possible to kill a PC and end a fellow player’s game. You can certainly attempt to kill a PC, and perhaps role-play the belief that a PC has been killed, but a PC will always narrowly survive. See Appendix 1 (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg9">pg9</a>) for an example playing a Scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="happenings">
<h2>HAPPENINGS</h2>
<p>Happenings provide context, direction, and consequences for the Scenes in each Event of the game. At the beginning of each Event, the designated first player rolls a d4 to determine the category (Family, Market, Gang, Cops), and then rolls a d12 to randomly determine the Happening within that category.</p>
<p>Some results describe Happenings that affect all players; other results describe risky but rewarding scenarios that players may elect to engage in; other results affect a player randomly selected by rolling a die. The Happenings table is located in Appendix 2 (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg11">pg11</a>).</p>
<img alt="_images/mr-mountain.png" class="align-center" src="_images/mr-mountain.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="hell-to-pay">
<h2>HELL TO PAY</h2>
<p>After all players have described their Scenes in the sixth Event, a winner is determined in the conclusion, Hell to Pay. The conditions of the game’s end are described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Condition 1</div></blockquote>
<p>If a player possesses both the highest Madness and highest Reputation scores, she automatically wins the game. Describe how your bold and beastly PC has gone berserk and ascended the ranks to rule the streets. All other players may describe their PCs’ doomed fates.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Condition 2</div></blockquote>
<p>If a player possesses the highest Madness but not the highest Reputation, then prepare for a bloody battle for top position. The player with the highest Madness must describe her PC’s diabolical scheme to rule the streets with supernatural powers. All other PCs must fight one another’s rival gangs in a last attempt to take down this beastly rival threat. In the event of a tie between two players with the highest Madness, each PC rolls a d12 and the highest roll wins. The loser must compete with other PCs in the bracket system described below. During all conflicts in Hell to Pay, PCs roll their dice as dictated in the Scoring section (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg2">pg2</a>) but also add their PCs’ Reputation scores to their rolls when determining a winner.</p>
<p>PCs who do not have the highest Madness roll off in a bracket system. The two players with the lowest Reputation scores battle one another first. Determine winners and losers until only one PC remains to battle the player with the highest Madness. This triumphant player has two choices: she may either battle the PC with the highest Madness alone or she may recruit her final defeated opponent to battle the beast together. As an alternative to the final roll off in the bracket system, the two last PCs standing can call a truce rather than roll off against each other and choose to team up against the player with the highest Madness.</p>
<p>The final battle involves a best 3 out of 5 roll off. If only two players are in contention, roll dice as dictated in the Scoring section (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg2">pg2</a>) with one addition: the PC with the highest Madness adds her Madness score to her roll and the opponent PC adds her Reputation score to her roll. If two players take on the PC with the highest Madness together, dice rules vary. Roll the highest die associated with either PC’s Reputation scores to represent both PCs, then add both PCs’ Reputation scores to the roll. For example, if the two PCs have Reputation scores of 5 and 8, they would roll 1d8+5+8 to represent them both.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome of this battle, describe the consequences in your story. Consider how the winner of the game seizes power, what it means if rivals collaborated, what happens to the gangs and characters of your world, and any other details that help shape an exciting conclusion.</p>
<p>See Appendix 2 (<a class="reference internal" href="#pg11">pg11</a>) for an example of Hell to Pay.</p>

<span id="pg9"></span><h2>APPENDIX 1 - SCENE PLAY EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Abbie: Okay, my character really needs to step up her game. I was thinking of going for Madness, but the Happening mentioned that I’d have to roll a lower die. Probably not a bad idea to get more Reputation anyway. I think I’ll set my Scene by the wharf. I’m going to meet my contact named...Rancid Randy! Hank, will you play Randy?</p>
<p>Hank: Yeah!</p>
<p>Abbie: Okay, I know that Randy is obsessed with these great chili dogs at the pier. I’m going to run into him at the diner while he’s eating. I want to see if I can convince you to make a better deal with my group.</p>
<p>Hank: Dang, you have to catch me while I’m minding my own business!?</p>
<p>Abbie: Yep. See, I figure things could get violent between you and me, so I want to set it somewhere public. Wait, I have an idea! What if we have to kind of speak in code since we’re at the diner. Like, Frankie, do you want to be the waitress behind the counter?</p>
<p>Frankie: Definitely.</p>
<p>Abbie: Okay. So, I walk in and sit down at the empty bar stool next to Rancid Randy.</p>
<p>Frankie: Hey, hun. What’ll you have?</p>
<p>Abbie: Give me two of these fine chili dogs like my friend here. And I punch Randy on the arm.</p>
<p>Hank: Once the waitress is out of the way I lean in. Jesus, I can’t catch a break from you. Why are you here?</p>
<p>Abbie: You know you can’t get rid of me. And don’t forget it. Bottom line is we need some more...</p>
<p>Frankie: And here’s some water, darling.</p>
<p>Abbie: Thanks. I guess the waitress is kind of hovering around filling up drinks and putting together an order. I say quietly, yeah, Randy, we need more...sodas, yeah, sodas, for this weekend’s...barbecue.</p>
<p>Hank: You know...I feel like I really looked over your budget and you can’t afford any more sodas.</p>
<p>Abbie: Maybe, maybe. But looking back at our arrangement, I think you could do better. I think for the same price of that RC Cola you’re bringing around you could really do Coca Cola.</p>
<p>Frankie: What was that? Sorry, we only have Pepsi.</p>
<p>Abbie: Oh, that’s fine. Anyway, Randy, you see where I’m coming from. You haven’t been pulling your weight on this...catering job...for a while now, but things have changed. It’s time to level up here.</p>
<p>Hank: Yeah...I don’t really see that happening. I’ve got some good things going here and I don’t see why I’d let you mess that up for me.</p>
<p>Abbie: Oh, Randy, you know my motto: no excuses! And I stretch my arms up, pretending to yawn, and reveal my gun in its holster. Okay, I’m going to roll to see if I can convince him to get straight with me here. My current Reputation score is 5 so that means I’ll be rolling a d6.</p>
<p>Hank: Right. And since Randy’s a criminal NPC, I roll a d6. So if you beat me, you’ll get 2 points.</p>
<p>Abbie: Let’s roll! Yes! I win. Deal with it, Randy! I’m up 2 points. And now that I’m at 7 I’ll be rolling a d8 for Reputation. I look Randy in the eye and can tell something sinks inside of him. It’s subtle, but as I stare him down, a ghastly green flame is in my eyes. He’ll back down now. I can tell he caves right as the food is ready.</p>
<p>Frankie: All right, two chili dogs for you. Anything else?</p>
<p>Abbie: Thanks! And yeah I think throw a milkshake on there. My friend here’s buying.</p>

<p>Steph: I have the highest Madness! Suck it! My psycho-ghoul is walking through walls and burning down buildings. You all can’t stop me.</p>
<p>Joe: Damn, and I was just one point behind. Now I have to see if there’s any chance my wimpy Reputation will help me. I was a beast but nobody respected me.</p>
<p>Rita: Right, Joe. You and Tim have the lowest Reputation scores. You need to roll off to see which gangs will go for the glory and take down that freak, Steph.</p>
<p>Joe: Okay, I have 1 Reputation, so I’ll roll a d6+1.</p>
<p>Tim: Yeah, and I have 5 Reputation, so I’ll roll a d6+5. Let’s roll!</p>
<p>Joe: Rolling! Crap, you win.</p>
<p>Tim: Ha! My samurai zombie crashes into your headquarters and starts slicing off people’s limbs left and right. You’re done for.</p>
<p>Rita: Don’t get too excited. Now you have to take me on. And I have a 7 Reputation, so I’m rolling a d8+7. I’m totally gonna get you.</p>
<p>Tim: Ah, that’s tough! Let’s go. Rolling! Yes! I actually won!</p>
<p>Rita: No!</p>
<p>Tim: I fly in with my samurai sword and I’m picking off your pathetic slime minions. I’m dodging your slime bazooka attacks like a boss until I’m right in front of you, sword to your throat. I breathe my vile zombie breath in your face and draw blood with the blade. Just when you think it’s all over, I pause. See, Rita, I need your character to join me if I’m going to win!</p>
<p>Rita: True, Steph has 12 Madness so it would just be your d6+5 against Steph’s d10+12. You’d be done for.</p>
<p>Tim: Right, that’s why I’m roping you into it. Plus, working together, we will get to use your d8 since it’s the highest of our dice + my 5 + your 7. It would be our d8+12 against Steph’s d10+12. We’d have a shot!</p>
<p>Rita: Obviously my character isn’t happy, but she’s bound to you showing her mercy. And I’d rather we both win than Steph!</p>
<p>Steph: Oh, hell no! No way.</p>
<p>Rita: It’s happening, Steph. Tim and I ride through the desert all night and we’re on your trail. I see that glowing yellow storm you’re brewing up in the mountains.</p>
<p>Steph: Yep, when I finish casting this spell, I’ll be taking you all out with my noxious psycho-storm.</p>
<p>Tim: Not if we have anything to say about it! I fly up the mountain on my hog and the moonlight shines off the samurai sword strapped to my back.</p>
<p>Rita: And my slime bazooka is set to kill.</p>
<p>Steph: Okay, let’s roll! Your highest die plus your combined Reputation scores. So that’s your d8+12 and my d10+12. Best 3 out of 5.</p>
<p>Tim: Rolling!</p>
<p>Rita: Yes! We actually did it, Tim!</p>
<p>Steph: Noooooo!</p>
<p>Joe: Oh! The comeback! Steph, why don’t you describe how you dramatically die. And Rita and Tim, congrats. But you’ll have to describe your characters’ futures now that your rival gangs have worked together...</p>
